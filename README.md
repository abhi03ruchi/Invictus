### Problem Statement 1: Designing a Balanced Neural Network for Facial Expression Recognition

## Introduction
<table style="border: none;">
  <tr>
    <td> This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised. </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Objective
To develop an improved system that can identify the appropriate emotion based on the user's exact facial expression at that specific moment.

## Backstory: Why We Built This Project
Although many assert to have an almost flawless system and to provide outcomes under ideal and favorable circumstances. Developing a system that is definitive in nature will be hampered by the great range of expressions people display and the variation in facial features among individuals. 
Therefore, creating a dependable system free of any defects found in the current systems is a difficult undertaking.
In todayâ€™s world the facial expression of the individuals is one of the prime source of study to determine the emotional state of the people. But the dataset available is highly imbalanced ,so dealing with it a great problem.
